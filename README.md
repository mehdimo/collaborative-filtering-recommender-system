# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System

Given a dataset of users that are associated with a dataset of items (e.g., movie rating by users, shopping carts of customers, etc.), we can use the pattern of similar users preferences to recommend new items for each user. 

In this simple application, we use [movie rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) to recommend new movies to users.

## How To Run
To run the application, in your terminal:
1. Change the directory to the current project
2. Run `python app\ui\main.py`
3. Open the url `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.
